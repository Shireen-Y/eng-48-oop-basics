# OOP Basics

This class is going to cover the basics of OOP

### Covered in this class:

**4 pillars**
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

Other learning outcomes:
- Git + GitHub
- Documentation with Mark Down
- Best practices and organisation


### Definitions

Add your definitions here

**Class**
- bluebrint of an object
- wraps method and attributes
**Methods**
- just like functions, they can take in arguments
- run a block of code
- they cn only be used by an instance of its class


**Attributes**
- Hold information about our SPECIFIC object
- Are set in the def__init__() method with arguments like any another function

**_ _init_ _()**
- AKA constructor or initialiser
- This method runs every time an object is created
 - So when you do:
 ````
    animal1 = animal('Fred', 10, 2)
 ````

**Instance / object**
- occurrence of an object

**Self**
- Refers to the object / instance

**Inheritance**
- Ability of classes to inhert characteristics (parameters) and behaviours (methods) from parent class

**Polymorphism**
- Poly = many
- Morph = forms
- Polymorphism = many forms
- The ability to change methods and characteristics of instances of child classes
    - Method polymorphism - at the method level

**Abstraction**
- Hiding complexity from the user
    -  Heating food in the microwave with one button.. What happens?
    - Changing gears in a car
    - Coding language and Binary in computing

## Specific to us, we will:
- Write nice documentation for how to import and use our code
- Use inheritance and importing to hide the code
- Ultimately we can package it into a module that could be imported with PIP
